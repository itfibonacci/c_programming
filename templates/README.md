# Implement the following templates

Logging Library: A library that provides functions for logging errors, warnings, and other information. This can be used in almost any project to help with debugging and error tracking.

Data Structures: Common data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. These can be used in a wide variety of applications.

Networking Library: Functions for setting up and managing network connections, sending and receiving data, etc.

Unit Testing Framework: A simple framework for writing and running unit tests. This can be used to ensure that your code is working as expected.

File I/O Library: Functions for reading from and writing to files. This is another thing that comes up in a lot of different projects.

Database Connection Library: If you frequently work with databases, having a library that handles connecting to the database, executing queries, and handling results can be very useful.

Configuration Library: A library to handle reading and writing configuration files can be a time saver in many projects.

These are just a few examples. The specific templates or libraries you create will depend on the types of projects you typically work on.
